<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a server that serves up a website for making blog posts. Users can sign in, create, view, edit, and delete posts. They can also leave and view comments on posts. All posts, comments, and user info is stored in a database that the site interacts with via its API.

[Here is a link to the deployed version of the app.](https://techl0rd.herokuapp.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Installation

The app does not need to be installed. Instead you can access it [here](https://techl0rd.herokuapp.com/). If you do want to run the app on your local machine, you can clone the repository, navigate to the directory it is saved to, and run the command "npm install" from the terminal. Using the MySQL shell or manager, import the schema "db/techblog_db.sql" to create the database. Create a file named ".env" in the root folder of the app and populate it according to ".env.example". Once you've set your environment variables, run "node server". Once the server is running, access the app in your browser at "localhost:3001".



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This app is made for anyone looking to make and share blog posts, or read those made by others. It could be repurposed for any topic, or even as an announcement board.



<!-- TESTING -->
## Testing

You can test the deployed version of the app at the link above. If testing a local copy, it is suggested that you use the command "nodemon server" to start the server. The API can be interacted with using Postman or Insomnia Core.
